# Svitlana's Daily planner

This simple calendar application was created to organize daily tasks, to-dos, thoughts, ideas, and save important events.  User saves events for each hour of the day.



## Description

This planner uses moments.js library to work with date and time. The planner displays business hours from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Past events turn grey, the current timeblock (hour) turns light red, while future timeblocks are green.
Once an event/todo/task was entered, a click on save button for that timeblock saves the event into a local storage.
